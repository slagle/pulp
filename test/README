Test cases are broken up into the following categories:

unit - Quick running tests that do not require a running pulp server.
       The database is required.

ws - Web service tests that require a running pulp server on the same machine.

rhn - RHN connectivity tests. These tests require that the machine be configured
      to connect to RHN with the following files:

      * /etc/sysconfig/rhn/systemid
      * /etc/sysconfig/rhn/entitlement-cert.xml

integration - A script that will install the latest pulp rpm and run the webservice 
              tests and eventually a series of CLI tests.

Additionally, the following directories are found in the testing root however

common - Utilities and data files common to all categories of tests.
