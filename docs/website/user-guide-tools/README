Just a quick note on usage. The following command can be run to pull
down the latest from the wiki and drop the updated HTML directly into
the git codebase. Once it's checked in, talk to jdob about getting the
new files pushed out to the production site.

python user_guide.py -d ../pulpproject.org/ug/


Alternatively, to run the site locally:
- Copy the contents of the pulpproject.org directory into somewhere in
  your httpd installation (for example, /var/www/html/pulp)
- Run the generate script specifying the location from above
  (don't forget to specify the ug subdirectory)

python user_guide.py -d /var/www/html/pulp/ug
