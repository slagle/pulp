<h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>
A Content Delivery Server (CDS) is a way to offload content serving from the Pulp server to a separate machine. A CDS is configured to host one or more repositories and consumers accessing those repositories are evenly distributed across CDS instances that serve them. The Pulp server is still used to manage and synchronize content into repositories; the CDS instances synchronize repositories from the Pulp server itself and make them available to consumers.
</p>
<p>
Having CDS instances present in a Pulp server influences the way consumer bindings function. If a CDS hosts a repository and a consumer request to bind the repo is made, the consumer will be directed to access the repo on the CDS. If multiple CDS instances all serve the same repository, consumers will be evenly distributed across all CDS instances.
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, consumers will be configured with the remaining CDS instances and the Pulp server itself as backups. This functionality works together to facilitate both load balancing and fail over scenarios to provide higher availability for hosted repositories.
</p>
<p>
Each CDS instance sends a heartbeat on a regular interval over the message bus.  This is used to determine the status of the CDS as it pertains to connectivity and availability.
The interval is specified in the <tt>/etc/cds.conf</tt> and can be different for each CDS.  The heartbeat statistics are included in the <em>list</em> and <em>info</em> CDS commands.
</p>
<h2 id="Overview">Overview</h2>
<p>
Installation and Configuration
</p>
<p>
A server is configured to run as a CDS by first installing the Pulp CDS package and its dependencies:
</p>
<pre class="wiki">$ yum install pulp-cds
</pre><p>
If not already installed, <tt>httpd</tt> will be installed as part of the installation process. The virtual host for the CDS is also installed through the <tt>/etc/httpd/conf.d/pulp-cds.conf</tt> file.
</p>
<p>
The CDS will need to be able to resolve the hostname of the Pulp server in order to be able to download content from it. This will typically be done through DNS, but in development environments this often means needing to edit <tt>/etc/hosts</tt> to add an entry for the Pulp server.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, the CDS will have to be configured to use the messaging broker on the Pulp server so it can be manipulated from the server itself. This is done through the <tt>/etc/pulp/cds.conf</tt> file:
</p>
<pre class="wiki">[server]
host = pulp.example.com
</pre><p>
Like the Pulp server itself, the CDS uses Apache to host its repositories. The typical steps to configure the Apache instance with an SSL certificate should be taken at this point.
</p>
<p>
Once the configuration changes have been made, the CDS processes are started through the init script:
</p>
<pre class="wiki">$ service pulp-cds start
Starting goferd                                            [  OK  ]
Starting httpd:                                            [  OK  ]
</pre><p>
Once the CDS server is running, it must be registered to a Pulp server. A CDS may only be registered to one Pulp server at a given time. Once registered, the CDS will only accept commands from the Pulp server that it is currently registered to. When a CDS is unregistered from a Pulp server, it is once again open to be registered by a different Pulp server.
</p>

<h2 id="reg">Registration and Unregistration</h2>
<p>
Before a CDS can be used, it must be registered with a Pulp server. Prior to registering a CDS instance, the CDS packages must be installed and started on the instance. The registration process will attempt to contact the CDS and will fail if it is unable to do so.
</p>
<p>
CDS registration is done through the <tt>pulp-admin</tt> script. Registration takes the following arguments (all arguments are optional unless otherwise specified):
</p>
<table class="wiki">
<tr><td> <strong>Name</strong> </td><td> <strong>Flag</strong> </td><td> <strong>Description</strong> 
</td></tr><tr><td> Hostname </td><td> <tt>--hostname</tt> </td><td> Required. Fully qualified domain name of the CDS. The CDS will use its hostname when determining its ID on the message bus, so this argument must be the same value the CDS will resolve.

</pre><p>
Once a CDS is registered, repositories can be associated with it and synchronized to the instance.
</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="repoassociation">Repo Association</h2>
<p>
Pulp repositories are assigned to CDS instances through a process called <em>association</em>. Once associated, a repository's contents will be sent to the CDS on the next sync.
</p>
<h3 id="Association">Association</h3>
<p>
Association is done through the <tt>cds associate_repo</tt> command. The two arguments, the CDS hostname and repo ID, are both required.
</p>
<pre class="wiki">$ pulp-admin cds associate_repo --hostname cds1.example.org --repoid repo1
Successfully associated CDS [cds1.example.org] with repo [repo1]
</pre><p>
Note that the repository contents are not immediately sent to the CDS. This allows multiple repos to be configured for a CDS before initiating the synchronization. The sync must be manually run with <tt>cds sync</tt>.
</p>
<h3 id="Unassociation">Unassociation</h3>
<p>
Similarly, a previously associated repository can be removed from a CDS through the <tt>cds unassociate</tt> command. This command takes the same two required arguments.
</p>
<pre class="wiki">$ pulp-admin cds unassociate_repo --hostname cds1.example.org --repoid repo1
Successfully associated repo [repo1] from CDS [cds1.example.org]
</pre><hr />
<h2 id="sync">Synchronization</h2>
<p>
Synchronization is the process by which the CDS downloads content for all associated repositories. Any previously synchronized repos that have been unassociated from the CDS are removed during this process. Any updated content to existing repositories is downloaded to the CDS.
</p>
<p>
The <tt>cds sync</tt> command is used to trigger an immediate synchronization for the CDS indicated by the only argument <tt>--hostname</tt>.
</p>
<pre class="wiki">$ pulp-admin cds sync --hostname cds1.example.org
Sync for CDS [cds1.example.org] started
Use "cds status" to check on the progress
</pre><p>
The status of the sync, along with previous syncs, can be retrieved with <tt>cds status</tt>. Additionally, the <tt>--recent=N</tt> flag can be specified to view the results of the last N many sync operations.
</p>

</pre><hr />
<h2 id="clusters">Clusters</h2>
<p>
A CDS <em>cluster</em> is a mechanism to enforce consistency across CDS instances. Repository associations for CDS instances in the same cluster are kept identical by the Pulp server, primarily falling into one of two categories:
</p>
<ul><li>When a CDS is added to a cluster, its repository associations are modified to match the other members of the cluster. This may include removing previous associations that are not present in the cluster.
</li><li>When repository associations are added/removed from a CDS in the cluster, all CDS instances in the cluster are modified.
</li></ul><p>
A CDS can only belong to one cluster at a time. Clusters do not need to be explicitly created or deleted; clusters are determined by inspecting metadata on CDS instances themselves. A cluster ID must adhere to the <a class="wiki" href="UGGeneral.html#id">standard Pulp guidelines for IDs</a>. Cluster membership can be set at registration time or on an existing CDS through the <tt>cds update</tt> command.
