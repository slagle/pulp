    # This is incorrect; this circumvents the round robining and funnels
    # all URLs to a single CDS. This is why the method was flagged as
    # a private method in the first place, it's not meant to be used like this.

    # After looking further, this is bad in a lot of ways:
    # - Performance-wise, it doesn't scale for a lot of repos, we need
    #   a batch call to not pound the database.
    # - It's inconsistent; calling GET on the same repository may result
    #   in different URIs if the next permutation changes.
    # - I'm not sure what the intention of this method is, but the CDS instances
    #   are typically used for consumer load balancing and firewall considerations.
    #   I'm not sure if this method is trying to return a URL fit for consumer
    #   usage, but if it is it should return information on all CDSes, not simply
    #   a random one (random since next_permutation will change).
