Validation package that contains modules for validating HTTP input for
manipulating resources in the top-level collections.

This package implements a module per top-level collection and the imports that
module directly into the package to avoid namespace collisions. A developer only
needs to import this package to use the validation modules it contains.

For example:

from pulp.server.webservices import validation
input = validation.repo.update_input()

import timeout
