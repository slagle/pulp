These scripts will allow grinder to essentially mirror a pulp server.
 - We get a list of the repos from a pulp server
 - Then run grinder to sync each repo

 Motivation:    We are using these scripts to debug a memory leak.
                Desire is to isolate the grinder sync portion with the exact repos the pulp repo has been syncing.


1) Get a list of repos:  
  Run "repo_list.sh"  Update for username/password
2) Convert repo_list.json to a series of id,feed_url,feed_ca,feed_cert
  Output is: feed_urls
3) grinder_reproducer_memleak.py feed_urls
