The following configuration parameters can be passed to the distributor either
in its static configuration when it is added to a repo or with an individual
publish call.

write_files : If true, the distributor will copy the file created by the importer
  to the publish directory.

publish_dir : Location on disk the files will be written to when the repository
  is published. This has no effect if write_files is false.

publish_delay_in_seconds : Number of seconds to wait at the tail end of the publish
  before informing Pulp the operation has completed. This can be used to simulate
  a long running publish operation.
