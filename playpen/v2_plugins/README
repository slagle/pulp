This directory contains sample plugins that can be used for testing Pulp v2
capabilities.

The plugins need to be deployed to /var/lib/pulp/plugins, each in the appropriate
subdirectory. The install.sh script in this directory will create symlinks for
all of the included plugins. It's a bit sloppy, so subsequent invocations of it
will complain that the symlink already exists.

Each plugin can accept different configuration parameters that dictate how it
will behave. Details can be found in README files in each plugin directory.

The harness directory includes infrastructure to script out scenarios the
plugins should simulate. The harness.py script will use the configuration values
in scenarios/_default.ini and the scenario file passed at the command line to
make the appropriate REST calls to Pulp.

Example:
python harness.py scenarios/basic.ini

See the _default.ini file for more information on the parameters that can be
overridden in an individual scenario file.
